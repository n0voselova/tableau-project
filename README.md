# NYC Tree Census and Income: Data Visualization

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive visualization of the New York City Tree Census in relation to income across different boroughs. Utilizing Tableau, I merged and analyzed data from three CSV datasets to reveal insights into the urban ecosystem of Metro New York. 

The aim was to create a narrative that not only showcases the distribution and health of trees across the city but also initiates a discussion on environmental equity linked to neighborhood incomes.

## Key Insights
- **Tree Count**: Metro NY boasts 683,788 trees, highlighting the city's commitment to green spaces.
- **Tree Distribution**: A borough-wise breakdown reveals Queens leading in tree count.
- **Income and Trees**: How does tree density correlate with the affluence of a neighborhood?
- **Tree Health**: Contrast of tree conditions across different economic areas to discuss environmental justice.

## Visualization Dashboard Components
The dashboard consists of several interlinked visualizations:
- Total Trees in Metro NY
- Trees Across Boroughs
- Income Across Zip Codes
- Tree Health in Richest vs Poorest Areas
- Tree Trunk Diameter
- Tree Status

## Process
1. **Data Setup**: Began by setting up the data, including joining three csv files.
2. **Initial Sketches**: Visualization ideas were first sketched on paper to plan out the design and flow of the dashboard.
3. **Creating Visualizations**: Developed individual visualizations in Tableau and adjusted their aesthetic properties to enhance the narrative.
4. **Dashboard Assembly**: Combined all visualizations into a single, cohesive dashboard, refining the layout for context and visual balance.
5. **Tableau Public**: Published the final work to Tableau Public for broader accessibility.
